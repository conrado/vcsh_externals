vcsh external repos
-------------------

This file is part of the vcsh external repos collection, which is essentially just a collection of git repos turned into git submodules, in order to place them in the correct locations through symlinks.

This is necessary since git submodules do not allow for .gitmodules files from different repositories to co-exist.

Currently there are two repos added in here::

    oh-my-zsh
    spf13-vim
